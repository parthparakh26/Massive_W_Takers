            Teachers and Schools can use the Smartmcq authoring tool to create worksheets easily in a few seconds. They
            can avoid repetitive questions chosen from a fixed question bank every year.

        <div className="card">
          <img src={card2} alt="Teachers and Schools" style={{ width: '360px', height: '300px', margin: '0 auto' }} />
          <p>
            HR teams can use Smartmcq to create assessments from compliance documents. Every time there is a change in
            policies, assessments could be generated and given to employees to make sure that they have read and
            understood the new policies.
          </p>

        {/* Card 3: Publishers and Edtech Companies */}
        <div className="card">
          <img src={card3} alt="Teachers and Schools" style={{ width: '300px', height: '300px', margin: '0 auto' }}/>
          <p>
            Textbook publishers and edtech companies can use Smartmcq instead of outsourcing the assessment creation
            process. They can have a small in-house team and save hugely on time and cost.
